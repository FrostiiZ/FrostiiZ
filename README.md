# Hello internet ðŸ‘‹

## Who am I ?
Iâ€™m @FrostiiZ, it's not the best nickname, heh, but it's mine.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in everything related to new dev technologies and I love seeing new cool open-source ideas.
- I live in France, close to vine fields where the atmosphere is really intimate.
  - The best kind of wine I can advise to try here, even tho it's a bit costly, is Gewurztraminer "vendanges tardives", it tastes so good...

## What's your thing ?
- I started as a C developer, recoding everything from the sys lib, along with some cool projects in the terminal (termcaps = good, ncurses = cursed).
- I've stepped into OOP in 2015 with C++, Java and VB.net, which were cool experiences !
- I'm now working into full-stack web stuff, mainly with Laravel, Vuejs, Vuetify, Inertiajs and PHP. That's a cool dev stack, you should try it !
- I like playing with servers and docker, my home server is running Unraid (I love it) and all my web services are into docker containers. I'm able to deploy pretty much everything I want.

## Future goals ?
- I wanna work with a fully automated stack where a pull-request on the main brainch triggers CI/CD functions and deploys my code on my server, with A/B testing and auto-fallback if the update fails.
- I'm thinking about using Kubernetes, but I'm also interested in AWS Firecracker, I'll see...
- Professionally, I just want to make cool projects that people love to use. I'm not a web designer by any means, but I'm willing to up my knowledge of UI design, so I can develop cool stuff, with cool UIs.

My only barrier to perfection is time, I've learned how to trace a line between great (enough) and over-engineering. I don't wanna blow-up my sleep schedule just because there's a wrong 1px gap that triggers my OCD.
